		<p align="left">The United States is a highly developed country with a market economy and has the world's largest nominal GDP 
		and net wealth. It has the second-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) behind China. It had the world's eighth-highest 
		per capita GDP (nominal) and the ninth-highest per capita GDP (PPP) in 2022. The United States has the most technologically 
		powerful and innovative economy in the world. Its firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in 
		artificial intelligence, computers, pharmaceuticals, and medical, aerospace, and military equipment. The U.S. dollar is the 
		currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, its military, 
		the petrodollar system and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market. Several countries use it as their 
		official currency and in others it is the de facto currency. The largest U.S. trading partners are China, the European 
		Union, Canada, Mexico, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan. The U.S. is the world's largest importer 
		and the second-largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA, Australia, South 
		Korea, Switzerland, Israel and several others that are in effect or under negotiation.
        <br><br>
        The nation's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity. 
		It has the second-highest total-estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$ 44.98 trillion in 2019, although sources 
		differ on their estimates. Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. 
		In 2013, they had the sixth-highest median household income, down from fourth-highest in 2010.
        <br><br>
        By 1890, the United States had overtaken the British Empire as the world's most productive economy. It is the world's 
		largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. In 2016, it was the world's largest trading country as well as its 
		third-largest manufacturer, representing a fifth of the global manufacturing output.[55] The U.S. not only has the largest 
		internal market for goods, but also dominates the services trade. U.S. total trade amounted to $4.2 trillion in 2018. Of 
		the world's 500 largest companies, 121 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S. has the world's highest number of billionaires, 
		with a total wealth of $3.0 trillion. US commercial banks had $20 trillion in assets as of August 2020. US Global 
		assets under management had more than $30 trillion in assets.
        <br><br>
        The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume. Foreign 
		investments made in the U.S. total almost $4.0 trillion, while American investments in foreign countries total over $5.6 
		trillion. The U.S. economy is ranked first in international ranking on venture capital and Global Research and Development 
		funding. Consumer spending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2018, while its labor share of income was 43% in 
		2017. The U.S. has the world's largest consumer market. The nation's labor market has attracted immigrants from all over 
		the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in 
		studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global Competitiveness Report, and others.
        <br><br>
        The U.S. economy experienced a serious economic downturn during the Great Recession, defined as lasting from December 2007 to 
		June 2009. However, real GDP regained its pre-crisis (late 2007) peak by 2011, household net worth by Q2 2012, non-farm 
		payroll jobs by May 2014, and the unemployment rate by September 2015. The United States ranked the 41st highest in income 
		inequality among 156 countries in 2017, and the highest compared to the rest of the Western world. Each of these variables 
		continued into post-recession record territory following those dates, with the U.S. recovery becoming the second-longest on record 
		by April 2018.
