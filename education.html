		<p align="left">Education in the United States is provided in public, private, and home schools. 
		State governments set overall educational standards, often mandate standardized tests for K–12 public school 
		systems and supervise, usually through a board of regents, state colleges, and universities. The bulk of the 
		$1.3 trillion in funding comes from state and local governments, with federal funding accounting for only about 
		$200 billion. Private schools are free to determine their own curriculum and staffing policies, with voluntary 
		accreditation available through independent regional accreditation authorities, although some state regulation can apply.
        <br><br>
        In 2013, about 87% of school-age children (those below higher education) attended state funded public schools, 
		about 10% attended tuition- and foundation-funded private schools, and roughly 3% were home-schooled.
        <br><br>
        By state law, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between 
		ages sixteen and eighteen, depending on the state. This requirement can be satisfied in public schools, state-certified 
		private schools, or an approved home school program. In most schools, compulsory education is divided into three levels: 
		elementary school, middle or junior high school, and high school. Children are usually divided by age groups into grades, 
		ranging from kindergarten (4 to 6-year-olds) and first grade (6 to 7-year-olds) for the youngest children, up to twelfth grade 
		(17 to 18-year-olds) as the final year of high school.
        <br><br>
        There is also a large number and wide variety of publicly and privately administered colleges and universities throughout 
		the country. Post-secondary education is divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school. Higher 
		education includes extremely wealthy and selective universities, public research universities, private liberal arts colleges, 
		historically black colleges and universities, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and many other kinds and combinations of 
		institutions. College enrollment rates in the United States have increased over the long term. At the same time, student loan 
		debt has also risen to $1.5 trillion. According to a 2016 report published by the U.S. News & World Report, of the top ten colleges 
		and universities in the world, eight are American (the other two are Oxford and Cambridge, in the United Kingdom).
        <br><br>
        The United States spends more per student on education than any other country. In 2014, the Pearson/Economist 
		Intelligence Unit rated U.S. education as 14th best in the world. The Programme for International Student Assessment 
		coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of American 15-year-olds as 31st in the world in 
		reading literacy, mathematics, and science with the average American student scoring 487.7, compared with the 
		OECD average of 493. In 2014, the country spent 6.2 percent of its GDP on all levels of education – 1.0 percentage points 
		above the OECD average of 5.2 percent. In 2017, 46.4 percent of Americans aged 25 to 64 attained some form of post-secondary 
		education. 48 percent of Americans aged 25 to 34 attained some form of tertiary education, about 4 percent above the OECD average 
		of 44 percent. 35 percent of Americans aged 25 and over have achieved a bachelor's degree or higher. 
		The United States ranks 3rd from the bottom among OECD nations in terms of its poverty gap, and 4th from the bottom in terms of 
		poverty rate.
